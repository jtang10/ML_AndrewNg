### Overview
This is a repo containing the Coursera Machine Learning assignments implemented in Python.

I followed [JWarmenhoven](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/Coursera-Machine-Learning)'s work. I found his repo in Google search and **all
credits to him**. I use this to learn maching learning, iPython, Numpy, etc. The codes here could look the same sometimes as his because I
just copy and paste to figure out how it works. However, he seems like using Python 3.x while I am using 2.7 so some functions look a
little different. I will try to write my own code soon as I learn how to.
